# Frontend Mentor - Intro section with dropdown navigation

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Small landing page, with dropdown nav menu and hamburger menu on mobile version. I'm not fully proud of this challenge and have I have to do some fixes in future. But of course major things works very well and for me it looks pretty nice!
